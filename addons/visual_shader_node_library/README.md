# Godot - Visual Shader Node Library

This is a collection of additional shader nodes ( + examples) that can be used in the visual shader editor to achieve common tasks faster, without the need of hundrets of nodes.
Currently most nodes are for 3D, but more nodes for 2D, Particles and common tasks will probably added in the future too. 

#### Feel free to request or contribute nodes to the library. :)

## Installation
 Just download into your projekt folder. The nodes are automatically added to shader editor.
 Example materials can also be found in the examples folder.

 Note this is a early version so it's possible that some things will be changed in the future.
